CoLTE is the Community LTE Project. It is designed to be an all-in-one turnkey
solution that sets up a small-scale locally-run LTE/5G network. CoLTE consists of
several main elements working together:

1. An all-in-one software EPC, powered by [open5gs] (https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs).

2. Network monitoring software, powered by haulage, to keep track of how many
   bytes each user uses and bill appropriately.

3. A Web GUI that lets network users check the status of their account, top
   up, transfer/resell credit, and buy data packages.

4. A Web-based admin tool that lets administrators manage all the information
   above.

5. Local Web and DNS serving/caching via Nginx and BIND.
